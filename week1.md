## DAY 2 OF PROGRAMMING

## Python
---

### Things we worked on:
- hello world
- variables
- numbers
- strings
- comparisions-conditions-and booleans

---

1. **Hello World**

*Print "Hello World!"*
 

Example:

```
- Hello

  print("Hello World")`

  python3 hello-world.py`

 - Goodbye

  print("Goodbye world")`

  python3 goodbye-world.py`
```

---

2. **Variables**

- Variable - Symbolic name given to an unknown quantity that permits the name to be used independent of the information it represents.


Example:

```
Code will display in order

print("Hello, my name is:")
first_name = "Sarah"
print(first_name)

last_name = "Smith"
print(last_name)

print("I am ")
age = 10
print(age)
print("years old")
```

---

3. **Numbers**

- Integer - A data type in many languages that represents a real integer. Integers allow for mathmatical operations.


Example:

```
# Adding two numbers together
a = 1
b = 2
print(a+b)


# age divided by the year
age = 66
graduated = 1950
result = age/graduated
print(result)

# my_number
my_number = 10
increment_by = 20
print(my_number)
print(increment_by)

my_number += increment_by
print(my_number)

my_number += increment_by
print(my_number)

my_number += increment_by
print(my_number)
```

---


5. **Strings**

- String - Is a data type that is a grouping of text, numbers, and charecters.

 Contatenation ( f, + %)

Example:

```
Concatenate 2 variables

a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
print(c)
```
```
Add space between them, use: " "

a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
print(c)
```
---
6. **Comparisions-Conditions-Booleans**


Example:
```
##using and
if all of the conditions are met or true use - and

##using or
if only one of out all the conditions are met use - or


# 2
my_number = 13
print(my_number == 2) 
print(my_number < 14) 
print(my_number == 2) 


#3
name = "Melody"
if name == "Melody":
    print("Yes these strings are the same!")

if name != "Samson":
    print("NO These strings are different!")  
```
Falsy Values:

- None
- False
- 0
- " "
- [ ]
- { }
- set ( )

### Things we worked on:
- user-input
- else-if
- nesting / muiltiple conditions
- loops
- error handling
---
1. **User-input**

```age = input("How old are you?\n")
if int(age) >= 21:

age = int(input("How old are you?\n"))

if age == 21:
  print("You are a great age to party.")
#elif age >= 21:
  print("You are old enough")
#else:
  print("You are not old enough")
  ```
---

2. **Else-if**

```

num = input("Pick a number: ")

if int(num) == 40:
    print("The number you picked is correct!") 
elif int(num) >= 40:
    print("The number you picked is high.") 
else:
    print("The number you picked is too low.")

```    
---

2. **Nesting / Muiltiple Conditions**

```

pet_name = input("What is your pet's name?\n")


if len(pet_name) < 3:
    print("Your pet's name is too short") 
elif len(pet_name) > 3:
        print(f"AWWW sweet {pet_name} ")  
        if pet_name == "Shadow":
            print("El Gato Diablo!")
        elif pet_name == "Daisy":
                print("Good doggie!")
        
```

``` 
REMEMBER: int: function converts a numeric string to a number



if int(num) == 40:
    print("The number you picked is correct!")

```
