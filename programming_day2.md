## DAY 2 OF PROGRAMMING

## Python
---

### Things we worked on:
- hello world
- variables
- numbers
- strings
- comparisions-conditions-and booleans

---

1. **Hello World**

-  What did we do?  *Print "Hello World!"*
 
- How did you do it?

Example:

```
- Hello

  print("Hello World")`

  python3 hello-world.py`

 - Goodbye

  print("Goodbye world")`

  python3 goodbye-world.py`
```

---

2. **Variables**

- Variable - Symbolic name given to an unknown quantity that permits the name to be used independent of the information it represents.

-  What did we do?

- How did you do it?

Example:

```
Code will display in order

print("Hello, my name is:")
first_name = "Melody"
print(first_name)

last_name = "Ulep"
print(last_name)

print("I am ")
age = 10
print(age)
print("years old")
```

---

3. **Numbers**

- Integer - A data type in many languages that represents a real integer. Integers allow for mathmatical operations.

-  What did we do?

- How did you do it?

Example:

```
# Adding two numbers together
a = 1
b = 2
print(a+b)


# age divided by the year
age = 66
graduated = 1950
result = age/graduated
print(result)

# my_number
my_number = 10
increment_by = 20
print(my_number)
print(increment_by)

my_number += increment_by
print(my_number)

my_number += increment_by
print(my_number)

my_number += increment_by
print(my_number)
```

---


5. **Strings**

- String - Is a data type that is a grouping of text, numbers, and charecters.

-  What did we do?
1. Contatenation
2.

- How did you do it?

Example:

```
Concatenate 2 variables

a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
print(c)
```
```
Add space between them, use: " "

a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
print(c)
```
---
6. **Comparisions-Conditions-Booleans**



- What did we do?

- How did you do it?

Example:

```
# 1
print(1 == 3) 
print(4 <= 4) 
print("a" == "a") 
print(10 > 11) 
print("b" > "c") 

# 2
my_number = 13
print(my_number == 2) 
print(my_number < 14) 
print(my_number == 2) 


#3
name = "Melody"
if name == "Melody":
    print("Yes these strings are the same!")

if name != "Samson":
    print("NO These strings are different!")  
```
Falsy Values:

- None
- False
- 0
- " "
- [ ]
- { }
- set ( )
