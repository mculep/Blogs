## HTML TAGS

-   HTML - Html is an acronym for Hypertext Markup Language. It is a language
    that only describes the stucture and provided content of a document. All websites are creating using HTML
-   Symantic HTML - symantic HTML is concenpt where the html document is written in a way where each tag has meaning and purpose and tags are not used to change the layout or look of a page
-   HTML Element - The actualy item that the tag represents is the html element

```
  <!-- HTML Comment -->
  <div> Content </div>
```

```
  <!-- HTML doesn't care about spaces for the most part -->
  <div>
      Content
      Is spaced
      But not on the page

```

```
 Common HTML tags

  <div> content </div>
  <span> content </span>
  <h1> Heading 1 </h1>
  <h2> Heading 2 </h2>
  <!-- down to heading h6 -->
  <p> Paragraph content </p>
  <section> Sectional Content </section>
```

## HTML NESTED TAGS

---

-   Nest HTML tags
-   Some tags need nesting
-   Gotchas
-   Exercise

```
 <!-- simple nesting -->
  <div>
      <p>
          I am some content
      </p>
      <p>
          I am more content
      </p>
  </div>

```

```
  <!-- Deep level nesting -->
  <div>
      <section>
          <p>
              Things are good today.
              <span>
                  Really Good!
              </span>
          </p>
      </section>
  </div>

```

```
- Some tags need to be nested

<ul>
      <li> Peas</li>
      <li>Carrots </li>
      <li>Potatoes </li>
  </ul>

  <table>
      <tr>
          <td> Peas</td>
          <td> Carrots</td>
          <td> Potatoes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Ice Cream</td>
          <td>Pancakes</td>
          <td>Baklava</td>
      </tr>
  </table>

```

```
- GOTCHAS

  <!-- opening and closing tags mixed up -->
  <div>
      <p>
          <span>
          Some content to use
      </p>
          </span>
  </div>

- BAD PRACTICES

  <!-- bad practices -->
  <!-- Using hr to draw line is not symantic -->
  <hr />
  <hr />
  <hr />

  <b>B is bold. IT is not symantic but is a style. HTML is not supposed to use style</b>
  <i> Like B I means itallic. HTML is not supposed to represent style.</i>

```

# HTML ATTRIBUTES

---

HTML Attribute - HTML attributes are special words inside of tags that can modifiy the tags behavior or help identify the tag.

## What is a HTML attribute

---

```
  <!-- The 'href' is the attribute -->
  <a href="http://google.com">Goto Google</a>
  <!-- 'src' is the attribute -->
  <img src="kittens.jpg" />

```

```
Most attributes are to be used with a specific tag only. If added to tags that do not deal with that attribute they will be ignored.

  <a href="http://google.com" id="first-link" class="nav-link" >
  Google</a>
  <!-- Each tag can have multiple attributes. Order does not matter. -->

```

## Common Attributes

---

```
  <div id="main-content">Main Content</div>
  <!-- hyphen case is the standard, but not required, for id and class names -->
  <section class="side-content">
      Here is some side content
  </section>

```
